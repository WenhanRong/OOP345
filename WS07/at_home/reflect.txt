Reflection for Workshop 7

1. We use vector containers versus other STL containers because vectors are the most
efficient of the containers. Vectors also store their elements contiguously, making
them simpler to access for printing, in this context. We also didn't benefit from 
having double ended access in this exericise. 

2. Below is a list of the STL template functions used in my solution:
.pushback()
.begin()
.end()
.size()


3. Below are the places I used a lambda expression:

	- as part of T mean() const: 
		T result = std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), (T)0, [](T &acc, const point &p) {return acc + p.second; });
	- as part of T sigma() const:
		T stdev = std::accumulate(data.begin(), data.end(), (T)0, [avg](T &acc, const point &p) {return acc + std::pow(p.second - avg, 2); });
	- as part of T median() const:
		sort(newdata.begin(), newdata.end(), [](const point &a, const point &b) {return a.second < b.second; });
	-as part of void regression(T& slope, T& y_intercept) const:
		std::for_each(data.begin(), data.end(), [&](const point &p) {
				xy += p.first * p.second;
				x += p.first;
				y += p.second;
				x2 += std::pow(p.first, 2);
		});

4. Programming associated with STL is simpler since we do not need to program all the logic, 
and can used the templated funcations available to us. This makes it simpler for the 
programmer, and reduces the amount of code we write.
